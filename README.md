# Introduction 🌱
Our focused solution for a problem in our university is “waiting que in the canteen”.
We have 4 canteens in our university. All the students get lunch break at 12.00p.m. When we go for a canteen at that time, there is a huge line in the cashier to order the food. So, we come up with a solution for reduce the cashier que and increase the productive sales by introducing an online food ordering app. Our food ordering app have special features when we compared it with normal restaurant app. Only the people who have permission to enter the university premises can use the application.We also focus on how to minimize food wastage in our canteens. By launching this app, all the students, lecturers, staff and everyone inside the university will be able to select a meal without walking far and order online. If the university allows to add a delivery service, we also can add a delivery function to our app as well.
With a high secured payment gateway, all the users including students and lecturers can easily place through the app and pick their meals from canteens without wasting a second in a canteen que. 

# Features 🌱

**User Authentication:** To ensure that only university members can use the app, user authentication will be implemented using university email addresses or other 
  secure methods.

**Online Food Ordering:** Users will be able to place food orders online through the app, providing them with the convenience of ordering from anywhere on campus.

**Payment Options:** The app will offer multiple payment options, including debit card payments and the ability to pay when the food is delivered, giving users 
  flexibility and convenience.

**Real-time Menu Updates:** Canteens will have the capability to add, update, or remove dishes from the menu in real-time through a secure admin panel. Users will 
  receive notifications about these changes, ensuring they always have access to the latest menu information.

**Feedback and Suggestions:** Users will have a dedicated section in the app to provide feedback and suggestions, creating a direct line of communication between 
  customers and canteen management. This feedback can be used to improve the quality of service and menu offerings.

**Order Tracking:** Users can track the status of their orders in real-time, reducing wait times and uncertainty.

**Promotions and Special Offers:** Canteens can use the app to promote special offers, discounts, and events to attract more customers.
